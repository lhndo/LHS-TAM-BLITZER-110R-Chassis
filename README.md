## Description

This is a FDM redesign exercise based on the 1/10 scale Tamiya Blitzer R/C chassis released in 1992 with the Tamiya Stadium Blitzer car, and later with the Tamiya Blitzer Beetle (my original kit).  

The project started with the intention of stiffening some of the original parts and having a source of spares which I could print, but ended up with a complete redesign that took a month an a half.  
I have tried to match the mounting points, so most of the parts are interchangeable with the original chassis, noting that my references were my trusty calipers and my Tamiya kit.  

The car is printed on the LH Stinger 3D Printer in PCTG, TPU 95A and PLA+, with a total weight of 2250g (4600mAh NiMh battery included), close to the original chassis.  

### Specs

Motor: G-Force Neo Fast 13.5T Sensored Brushless Motor (2700KV) on a 13T pinion (10:1 final ratio)  
ESC: QUICRUN 10BL120 SENSORED G2  
Battery: Voltz 4600mAh 7.2V NiMh
